1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,540
OK, so now we will see the new concept called branching.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:04,580
OK.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,930
So let me tell you one scenario.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,270
To understand why you're branching is necessary.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:21,430
OK, so now get X and get demo, other two people working from different time jobs and corroborating

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,130
each other with the help of Get Hub Central Depository.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,460
OK.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,870
So now these guys are concentrating on test, gives us development.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,400
So management decided to make some modifications on FRIM itself.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,180
OK.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,280
To make it more optimizer able are to introduce some new futures.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,370
So they want to implement and enhance this framework to the next level.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,050
So they have hired one architect maybe in both places.

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:01:00,280
And their job is to concentrate on framework components building, not on test cases.

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,790
OK.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,620
These two guys are continuing the test gives this development for their regular deliverables.

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:14,700
But these architects have to now focus on the project structure, like introducing a new FUT. like Dustin

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,010
G.

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,600
Maven.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,480
Are they want to drive the whole project from page object.

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,250
So they want to make many changes.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,040
OK.

23
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:30,120
But when these guys started putting the actual code framework fails, obviously these groups will start

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,280
fail, isn't it.

25
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,020
Now in start off for data driven framework.

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,850
If these guys are trying to implement base object, they will change some configuration files in the

27
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,330
framework.

28
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:40,600
Right.

29
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,390
If the genes test, cases will fail.

30
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,630
OK.

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,750
So they need at least one month to come up with a new framework.

32
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,200
But in that one month, these test cases will not run because of these guys changes.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:53,820
OK.

34
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,350
Because they're making changes component by component.

35
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,890
But these test cases are necessarily to run on every day basis.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,610
OK.

37
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,230
They have to learn on an everyday basis just because of some deliverable commitments.

38
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,020
OK.

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,240
In that situation, we will take a branch, OK?

40
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,510
Just as you make three.

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:15,880
OK.

42
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,600
Three is a mustard branch.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,350
OK.

44
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:27,340
From that master brand, we will take one more branch and some branch and that sub branch will actually

45
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,600
have the same core of what you have taken from or the general branch.

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,030
OK, master is our root branch.

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,410
So from our.

48
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,240
Let's take one branch and we will continue to work.

49
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,070
Architects basically can continue to work on this branch.

50
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:45,650
OK.

51
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,450
So all that development, whatever they are making, they do on the branch.

52
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,170
OK.

53
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,830
So in this vein, they are not.

54
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,470
That's in the master branch.

55
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,510
OK, Master Branch will continue to serve a regression.

56
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,340
This gets us on daily basis at the same time.

57
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,910
These guys have taken one more branch guard developed branch.

58
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,760
You could name it with anyone, but nonstandard people use to develop.

59
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,910
If it is a second branch after master.

60
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,930
So they develop branch.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,840
They're developing this stuff again, the same way.

62
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:24,490
If was an architect, how to catch up with this look, he will actually pull the devil branch in start

63
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,090
off Master Branch again, sort of master.

64
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,790
These guys will invoke and develop and they complete.

65
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,320
So after one month.

66
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:39,940
Once they realized that this branch is fully ready and executes all our test cases, they simply meant

67
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:47,110
that they will branch into the actual master branch after thorough testing, making sure this band is

68
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,570
not breaking, they will melt entire branch into the master branch in this way.

69
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,000
At the end, people all will start using master bands with the latest changes done by architect.

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,380
But that happens only after a few days.

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,610
Right.

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,370
Because they have to start working and make some changes.

73
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,200
So this is the concept.

74
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,160
Now we will see how to take the branches and how to work on need.

75
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,220
And finally, how do Misty's branches work?

76
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,600
We have taken into our action, master.

77
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,920
That's the agenda for this lecture.

78
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,120
All right.

79
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,330
So right now I am in Get Demel.

80
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,850
I will go back to my time in front.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,870
Let me go to any project so that we can dig the branch from there.

82
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,190
OK.

83
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,610
So right now, I made this project live in.

84
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:49,990
So this guy have to pick a brains because new architect Jarrin into the team.

85
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,010
OK.

86
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,430
This is Asian time, John.

87
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,610
When we say good them more, it's Asians.

88
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,690
Gays, OK, just for practice.

89
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,230
Just funny.

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,710
Not really time feel.

91
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,110
I am talking about this Joan time, John.

92
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,170
And that time, Joan, instead of confusing you between good demo and good stuff, I'm putting in this

93
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,900
terminology so that you'll remember.

94
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,980
OK.

95
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,430
There's nothing more than that.

96
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,160
OK.

97
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:21,010
So if you want to take a branch, if you want to cut a branch from this or you repository, we just

98
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,800
down here.

99
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,470
So that is a command to do that with get branch.

100
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,350
Hyphen.

101
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,510
Get take out.

102
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,200
OK.

103
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,860
Generally, we say take out the stuff, right?

104
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,520
Take out the brand, but create a new one when you want to create a new one.

105
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,260
Then you have to go.

106
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,990
Hyphen B, hyphen B stands for Creating New Branch.

107
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,540
OK.

108
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
You can get the same thing from this comment.

109
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,910
Basic good comments.

110
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,600
You can go through four master.

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,050
Here itself, you have good brands.

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,820
Is it missing here?

113
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,380
OK.

114
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,990
I think yeah, here it is.

115
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,380
Yeah.

116
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:22,720
Same thing, get take out hyphen B stands for Brand Name and you have to give the specific brands.

117
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,980
What do you want to create?

118
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,820
So here I will create the Willow branch.

119
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,760
So when you hit it that now it will create one more.

120
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,840
It klop is actually as one more quarter repository but it named it as the devil a branch so that you

121
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,030
can switch to that developed branch and you can work on died of that specific branch.

122
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,480
And once it is done you can mess that in.

123
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:51,670
Do what, actual masterbrand so that you know you are not disturbing that regular deliverables by taking

124
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,330
and adding separate branches.

125
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,850
So you don't end up.

126
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,690
It clearly says that switched to the new branch devil.

127
00:06:59,650 --> 00:06:59,890
OK.

128
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,810
So if you want to know what branch I'm currently in, just two wide confusion.

129
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,960
You can type get branch and he can enter.

130
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,520
It will tell you that there are totally two branches in.

131
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,390
You get a good demo project and right now you are on develop branch.

132
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,130
OK.

133
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,230
This is what it is saying.

134
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,780
That's the way you're trying as a start.

135
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:20,910
OK.

136
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,100
So automatically when you switch to that there will a branch.

137
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,370
And when you go to you want to get demo, you want a glimpse.

138
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,570
Also will shift.

139
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,920
Just click on this and you will see that it shifts to develop branch.

140
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,390
And now you'll start making changes, whatever the changes to make.

141
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,460
You will not disturb those in the branch.

142
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,130
OK.

143
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,200
So now I'll I'll start playing it on adding few apps.

144
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,250
So let's assume that architect is in the art of genius, right?

145
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,090
No, I'm from for example, I'm just blindly giving in sort of to this.

146
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,500
I create three dust and they'll say two Android apps.

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,980
Even that STPI a test instead of two, I will add one more test.

148
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,220
So I'm making some random changes here.

149
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,310
You see that three test cases out here and AP along.

150
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,380
So we have three test cases, but in master there are only two.

151
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,080
And here that are two.

152
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,350
Right.

153
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,120
I allowed one book.

154
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:31,620
New Ireland could treat us here, treat us here, three dates here.

155
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,280
Perfect.

156
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,440
Now, let's assume that the architect, how enough changes.

157
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,880
But he had to push his score to report because there is one more architect working in American time

158
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,790
zone and he has to pull his latest corps to work on that.

159
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,070
Well, a branch, OK.

160
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,590
There are two people working on it.

161
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,320
So he can he did not ah, he could not keep that in his local.

162
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,550
He has to push the court on daily basis.

163
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,210
So you're know.

164
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:58,410
Right.

165
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,590
How to do all this fast.

166
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,400
We will have that for our entire project of staging because we are already on Dola brands here now.

167
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,860
So why do they want operations to perform here?

168
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,270
Will point to develop only until unless you switch to master.

169
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,130
Each and every command you provide here will apply to this develop brains only.

170
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,880
So I'm reading I'm adding them to stating first.

171
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,230
OK.

172
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,010
And then we will come in.

173
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,670
And then we will push the cord.

174
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,500
What happens then?

175
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,390
So to get status.

176
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,520
To see what all the firefighter.

177
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,280
Yes.

178
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,360
That's DARPA selenium.

179
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,890
Why not IBM?

180
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,040
IBM is not at it, OK?

181
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,230
I think we have not saved.

182
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,560
But we've saved now.

183
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,780
And you'll say good status.

184
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,710
And now IBM.

185
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,200
OK.

186
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,140
Let me do it.

187
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,640
Add.

188
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,530
OK.

189
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,440
That's added.

190
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,210
Now.

191
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,010
Commit one citizen state and commit an act.

192
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,930
It's in.

193
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,200
Is she in development?

194
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,990
OK, so six Phyliss.

195
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,560
Twenty six inceptions, and you'll see that it has committed to the repository.

196
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,940
Okay, so now let me go back to the repository actually.

197
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,380
And now when you open this project.

198
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,500
You go back to my demo is our project, right?

199
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,650
OK, so now it can guy what does that come name?

200
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,750
Architect Asian Development.

201
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,020
Right.

202
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,210
So there should be a branch here.

203
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,860
I think it's not reflecting.

204
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,980
Oh, we need to push with our push.

205
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,420
How do you expect to see this.

206
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,380
Get my back.

207
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,540
I hope you guys got this.

208
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:07,890
Okay.

209
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,190
We just committed.

210
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,670
We did not push our brand story.

211
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,160
All right.

212
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,060
So without pushing, I'm going I'm sensing here for the brands, which is very bad.

213
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,360
Okay, so let's push this time.

214
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:29,410
I have to push the origin back to the developed brands, not to the mast, because I created one brand

215
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:34,290
and I am pushing that branch to that specific developed brands.

216
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,780
Only if you're right, master.

217
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,930
All your core goes to the master wrench, isn't it?

218
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,730
Now the architect is working on separate brands, which is developed.

219
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,390
So give.

220
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,790
Develop.

221
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,640
So that's why I did initially.

222
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,290
Right Master is what you do by default and you get as it develop.

223
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:52,680
OK.

224
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,380
And you'll see that Will Brands is recently created.

225
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,640
You recently boosted brands car devil.

226
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,310
OK.

227
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,400
And you can move like from master to develop like this.

228
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,500
So this is a branch of it.

229
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,070
Architects are looking unmastered is about reignition.

230
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,340
That's perfect.

231
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,940
Now let's go back to.

232
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,630
Asian architects have pushed the corps right?

233
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,970
Now it's time to switch to get X is a good X.

234
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,320
Yeah.

235
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,080
OK.

236
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,250
Here is where you are.

237
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,810
American Development Team is sitting.

238
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:37,110
So here is also one architect who had hired recently and he was asked to continue the work, which are

239
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,520
Asian architect is doing.

240
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,980
So the first step, he will actually pull the cord.

241
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,540
But this time he will say get pull all Jean Knaack Master.

242
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,270
It's devel up.

243
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:51,300
OK.

244
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,630
He has to pull devil develop.

245
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,470
Or at least we used to go masturbate by default.

246
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,640
But when you are working in branches instead of master.

247
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,910
Make sure you give the brand name which you are invested in.

248
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,140
Here it is.

249
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,400
Autogen, develop it and enter and that's it.

250
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,900
Everything is in your mission.

251
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,160
Now go to this.

252
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,890
Get X off your tips.

253
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,400
It is getting demo right.

254
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:15,460
Kidding.

255
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:17,680
Click.

256
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,570
Just click on this.

257
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,390
And it was sure.

258
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,190
OK, you have pulled out but you have not switched brands to that devil.

259
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,210
So right now you are in Master Branch.

260
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,620
How do you switch.

261
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,590
You are a brand from master to develop.

262
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,340
OK.

263
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,790
You have.

264
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,330
You have taken the latest gaud from develop into your mission.

265
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,990
That's fine.

266
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,820
But do you want current brands is pointing to master.

267
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,060
You have to switch it to development.

268
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,260
How to do that.

269
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,520
Simple.

270
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,650
Get take out.

271
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,310
So.

272
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,130
Kate, check out which brands you want to take out develop.

273
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,340
So give that develop.

274
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:57,600
OK.

275
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,640
You see that switched to a new branch, double up, that's all.

276
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:07,100
And now you move what it click on this and you'll see it automatically switch to develop.

277
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,880
OK.

278
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,270
So one thing you have to observe carefully.

279
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,410
If you want to create new branch, you have to provide a command.

280
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,820
Go get.

281
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,240
Check out.

282
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:19,670
Yeah.

283
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,680
You have to add this alphabet hyphen B so that it creates a new branch.

284
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,790
And so we just do it.

285
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,570
But if you want to switch to a new brand which is already created, then you can simply check out.

286
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,250
You can skip this hyphen.

287
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,530
B be OK.

288
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,010
Please remember the difference.

289
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,360
So if you want to create new then only to be used this hyphen B because we already done that.

290
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,050
So the simplest fixed using get checked out.

291
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,470
Come on.

292
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,740
And I just said you would all find it here.

293
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,970
Get checked out.

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,380
Get check or hyphen B.

295
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,240
And you know what branch you are in.

296
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,310
And if you're under Dillard branch you'll have to use hyphen D and give that that village the branch.

297
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,050
And if you want to push the scope of the specific branch.

298
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,540
Name.

299
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,670
Bush auditing develop.

300
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:07,750
OK.

301
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:09,510
Good.

302
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:15,880
Now, we have switched to to develop brands of our gate X.

303
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,510
OK.

304
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,400
So here.

305
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,120
You'll see that Mendola Brandon on three test cases.

306
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,890
Rich Asian development team have done.

307
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,970
And here we are seeing all the changes.

308
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:39,320
So now I'm at a game development team decided to add one more fee here.

309
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,270
Let's assume.

310
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,350
Yeah.

311
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,680
Just add one test.

312
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,450
That's in telling you, OK.

313
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,230
And then again, same stuff.

314
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,360
There is some concept are meant to conflict with tiles.

315
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,630
We're talking the next lecture.

316
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,140
Because that's the only tricky part in it.

317
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,010
What if there is a match?

318
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,060
Conflict happens.

319
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,370
And now you know what?

320
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,430
All this madness get Hubb intelligently doing it bite's loom.

321
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:13,450
Why take all your ad some time that if God could not understand your MIT concept, it might reject you

322
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,080
a little bit at that time?

323
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,180
We say it doesn't meant conflict at that particular time either.

324
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:26,390
We ourselves have to go and fix that test by writing the code, by looking oh, about heck.

325
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,240
What is the code present?

326
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,500
Presenting the basehead level.

327
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,680
And what is the court doesn't know what the local mission.

328
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,020
And we have the largest.

329
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,980
It does not do that work for us.

330
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,070
And as I told you, 95 percent of time.

331
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,340
Good.

332
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,570
Does that work for us?

333
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,180
But sometimes that is a probability.

334
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:41,960
Very good.

335
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,520
Face to match.

336
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,470
So at that time, we have to build that.

337
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:52,130
Look, I tell you one example in my dumb English, just like how the midst conflict can occur and how

338
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:52,870
can you fix it.

339
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,040
That being OK.

340
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,150
Just continue on the floor.

341
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,110
So right now we are dealing with masters, which we are going to grab.

342
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,130
So.

343
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:14,660
OK, so it's quick to stash and then come it's I hope, check if that selenium test is added.

344
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,460
OK, good.

345
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,010
Get Comet.

346
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,340
And development team.

347
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:30,580
OK.

348
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,190
Then you get Bush ordered in, developed.

349
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,260
Then and now, you'll see for selenium, there are four test cases out are right now.

350
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,480
Go back to your repository, refresh it and you will see.

351
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,060
I'm going to go in development team added a second to go.

352
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:56,690
OK.

353
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,500
You will clearly see it's fight.

354
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,250
Also, you'll see American Development.

355
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,210
This particular folder, architect, Asian Development, mortified.

356
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,990
These two files, which you can clearly see in there after American Development Team have modified this

357
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,910
file that you want.

358
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,380
They can.

359
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,170
And you can open that and you can see that lastly, OK, for this.

360
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,840
Now, let's assume that with this push, this plant is completely ready.

361
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:24,970
OK.

362
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:30,530
So earlier I a door that they'll be working by digging separate branch and they make modification to

363
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,170
that framework instantly.

364
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,420
OK, now let's assume that with this bushwalk, American guy had done an Asian development team.

365
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,050
Already did.

366
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,440
And now this gold is full fledged and it's ready to melt into master.

367
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,130
So that means now a team can use that on their daily basis.

368
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,640
OK.

369
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,560
It's like moving into production.

370
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,100
And we generally don't know how to move and met this mask.

371
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,570
This devilment branch into monster.

372
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,710
OK.

373
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,650
So you know that masteries only day can get a regression test cases.

374
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,270
And this they can get a frame.

375
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,530
But now both are ready.

376
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:14,120
And now we need to meth's does develop branch into monster and make this as one powerful framework with

377
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,300
all the frame stingiest.

378
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,130
And by architect.

379
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,540
So how to do that?

380
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:23,370
So for that, first you have to switch to Monster Branch.

381
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,230
Switch to monster transfers.

382
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,760
Get take out

383
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,670
monster.

384
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:33,750
OK.

385
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,330
And make sure you have the latest court.

386
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,400
You can do that.

387
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:43,830
Get full origin, master that just making sure that we are having the latest court, which is presenting

388
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:44,650
good.

389
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,510
Have a repository.

390
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:45,960
Good.

391
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,620
We are having the up to date court.

392
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,750
Now, if you want to meet Devil Brand once it is completely ready in.

393
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,170
Do you want regular deliverables, Master Branch.

394
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:03,380
You can simply do that at the gate met which branch you need to meet.

395
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,240
They will operate.

396
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:04,800
Develop.

397
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:05,920
OK.

398
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,440
If you like this developed branch, you will be missed in two.

399
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,720
You were active Bletch.

400
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,630
So he and I were active branches master because we just switched to the new branch master.

401
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:15,920
Right.

402
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,030
And the branch.

403
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,180
What you provide here will be missed into your master.

404
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,350
Same thing.

405
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:27,950
You will find the command here to get met to met a different branch into your active branch because

406
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,000
there's different brands.

407
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,380
Development is complete.

408
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,170
And now we want willing to mendicant lecture.

409
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,660
OK, so hit and enter.

410
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,800
And you'll see that then develop.

411
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,340
It's actually mess in master.

412
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:43,760
OK.

413
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,030
So Italy add in master.

414
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,870
We used to have only two test cases.

415
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,140
Right.

416
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,860
But in developed the immediate TADS cases.

417
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,310
And finally for selenium they made for disguises.

418
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:59,600
And now you'll see as we missed in door master, you will see all those genius in the master as well.

419
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:00,710
OK.

420
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,560
Where we are now.

421
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,090
Get X.

422
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,560
Get it.

423
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,280
There's nothing better.

424
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:03,950
This mission.

425
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

426
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,220
You'll see that this is a master branch now.

427
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,800
And master runs also.

428
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,980
You are seeing all the updated core whatever are done for development.

429
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,190
So that's why in develop we added one more test.

430
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,460
Right.

431
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,690
You're going to see that here.

432
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,470
And what IBM test.

433
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,480
Open that beam test.

434
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:31,110
OK, three test cases and arrest EPA test three, test every bit test cases.

435
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,600
OK.

436
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,600
Now, if you want to add one more test, you can do that as the new glass.

437
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,490
Daniel.

438
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,550
I'm just showing the sample, what if you add new test, if you add the new test, it will be first,

439
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,360
as you know, Kushan month and then now you are.

440
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,550
You want to master branches.

441
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,520
I mean, because I would have all the development just OK.

442
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:03,440
So if you want to add this file you filed against it, get at STOD and that will add the new project,

443
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,030
what you created here.

444
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,140
OK.

445
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,420
They our Java at Q8 Click Academy.

446
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,470
OK, you have done that here, right.

447
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,610
Perfect.

448
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:22,100
Now get X Master, have everything but get demo mastered.

449
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,760
We have to still pull that right.

450
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,410
So get X.

451
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,570
Let me push that door without quick comments.

452
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,670
We have them get out.

453
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:32,940
Right.

454
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,950
Get Kermit.

455
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,580
Final coming, because we have done all the tenders and everything finally coming by.

456
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,830
So or get extremely Zevo, it's.

457
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,340
They show the will of many people, then they are actually signing off on this project because they

458
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,680
have missed all the developing D.M. and I have done in the master.

459
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,750
Then I will say get push Autogen the master this time because we are working on a master advance only.

460
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,060
Right.

461
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,980
We have already Mr. Developed Branch and we are pushing out and died cord into Monster.

462
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,660
So it's already done.

463
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,860
Paul Gordon now isn't repository.

464
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,830
So now to the American development team.

465
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:30,070
So for them now, let me switch to the American label.

466
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,320
See you do da da C.D..

467
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,860
Get there more.

468
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,000
And here right now, I'm in Davila branch.

469
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,820
You can see it here.

470
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,420
You can also know they get branch come.

471
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,850
It says as a devil.

472
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,870
So I will actually do get checked out.

473
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,730
Devil M..

474
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,310
OK.

475
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:57,440
Once you've checked into the master branch initially, you will have only to test guesses because you

476
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:06,810
don't have a late escort and there is no demo file also with a simple pull gate full auditing master.

477
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,980
Everything will be in your mission now.

478
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,910
You'll see that and just click on this.

479
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,760
It will actually update stuff for you.

480
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,790
It refers to project.

481
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,420
Yeah, you'll see that.

482
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,420
Then why is up etting now and all the fortified inside information, three files and Selenia, which

483
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:27,960
should be full?

484
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,980
OK, so that's pretty much about branching.

485
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,450
And now you clearly know how to create their brand, how to work on it.

486
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,140
And once the development is damply, how do Mr. Brands, who do you are on master brands and how you

487
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,830
can do a push and pull with the different people coordinating each of them?

488
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,710
Okay, so that's pretty much I learned this lecture.

489
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,520
And the next lecture will start looking at about Med's conflicts.

490
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,310
Okay.

491
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:54,990
Thank you.
